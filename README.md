**Some ideas:**
- *Store Button Click Counts Using an Object*: Instead of just displaying a message on button click, store how many times each button has been clicked using an object.
- *Store and Display User Click History Using an Array*: Instead of just showing the latest click, maintain a history of all clicks using an array and display them on the page.
